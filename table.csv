1,
2,"On April 18, 1521, the Imperial Diet, an assembly of the Holy Roman Empire’s leading princes and nobles, met in the German town of Worms (VOHRMSS). The previous day, the Diet had ordered a monk named Martin Luther to retract his writings, which defied the authority of the Roman Catholic Church. Now, in the emperor’s presence, Luther delivered a bold reply that would echo throughout Europe for decades: “Unless I am convicted by... Scripture or by evident reason... I cannot and will not recant....”"
3,"Angered by this defiance, Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, then barely 21 years old, issued a stinging rebuke. A single monk must not be allowed to deny what Christianity had held for more than a thousand years. To defend the Catholic faith, Charles declared, he was prepared to use “all my possessions, my friends, my body, my blood, my life, and my soul.” Thus were drawn the battle lines of religious conflict."
4,"At first it was mainly a conflict among European Christians. Backed by Germans who feared imperial power and resented Church corruption, Luther defied both emperor and pope. His success led others to do likewise, creating new religions that fragmented Western Christendom."
5,"Soon, however, the conflict was connected with worldwide developments. In 1521, as Charles vowed at Worms to defend the Catholic cause, his subjects were conquering distant lands such as Mexico and the Philippines, building a global Spanish empire. In ensuing decades, as officials and religious orders spread Catholicism throughout that empire, Charles and his heirs exploited its wealth to fight their European foes."
6,"The result was a century of religious strife, accompanied by zealotry and witch hunts. But it was also accompanied by increased global trade, new kinds of commerce and production, expansion of learning and literacy, and changes in family life. While Europe was torn by religious and political strife, its monarchs, missionaries, and merchants were forging global connections."
7,20.1 The Protestant Reformation
8,What were the main causes and effects of the Protestant Reformation?
9,"In 1500 almost all Western Christians still belonged to the Catholic Church. Headed by the pope and run by a hierarchy of bishops and priests, it had long been a source of authority and unity in the West. But soon this authority and unity were shattered by the Protestant Reformation, a movement to reform the Catholic Church that became a rebellion against it, resulting in the rise of a number of new non-Catholic Christian churches, collectively known as Protestant religions."
10,20.1.1 Roots of the Reformation
11,"The Reformation was rooted in two key concerns. One was corruption in the Roman Catholic Church, which most Europeans looked to for salvation. The other was political unrest in the Holy Roman Empire, an assortment of Central European states, loosely united by their recognition of its emperor as overlord (Map 20.1)."
12,"Renaissance Europe had sophisticated culture, but death and disease still surrounded its people, whose main concern was thus eternal salvation: when they died, would their souls go to heaven or hell? Most believed that the Catholic Church held the keys to salvation, providing the rules and rituals needed to reach heaven. Chief among the rituals were sacraments, sacred rites believed to bestow the graces needed for salvation."
13,"The main Catholic sacraments were baptism, the Eucharist, and penance. To make it to heaven, one first had to undergo baptism, the ritual use of water that brings membership in the Church. Then one had to lead a virtuous life, doing good works and avoiding serious sins. Those who committed such sins and died with them unforgiven were damned to eternity in hell. But through the Eucharist (or Communion), the consumption of consecrated bread and wine believed to be Christ’s body and blood, Christians could gain grace to avoid sin. And through penance, the confession of one’s sins with sincere repentance to a priest, Christians could have their sins forgiven."
14,"After that, however, they still had to atone for their sins. If they died without doing so, the Church taught, they had to endure purgatory, a place of suffering that purified the soul so it could enter heaven. But people could also atone for sins while still alive. Through certain prayers and sacrifices—such as fasts, pilgrimages, and charitable works—they could earn an indulgence, a remission of the punishment still due for sins that had been forgiven through confession, to reduce or eliminate suffering in purgatory. As popes started granting indulgences for financial sacrifices, such as donations to the Church, it began to look as if people could purchase salvation."
15,"This practice, which critics called the “sale of indulgences,” was one of the abuses that added to Church wealth and corruption. Others included simony (SIH-muh-nē), the sale of Church offices and benefits, and pluralism, a practice by which some clerics held multiple church offices, thereby enhancing their incomes. Furthermore, while popes and bishops lived lavishly in sumptuous palaces, poorly educated parish priests were often neither sober nor chaste."
16,"Over the years, several individuals had condemned such abuses. John Wyclif (WICK-liff) (1330–1384), theology professor at England’s Oxford University, denounced the sale of indulgences and Church offices. Asserting that the Church must practice piety and poverty, he called on civil rulers to reform it and seize its possessions. He also declared that divine authority rested in the Bible, not the Church. His followers, called Lollards, were harshly suppressed, with some even burned to death as heretics. Another Church critic was John Hus (1369–1415), rector of Prague University, who promoted similar ideas in Bohemia (now the Czech Republic). In 1415 he was invited to a Church council with a promise of safe conduct but then convicted of heresy and burned to death at the stake. For the time being, the Church thus silenced its dissidents."
17,"In time, however, Renaissance popes supplied new reasons for resentment. Pope Sixtus IV (1471–1484) sold Church offices to enrich his family and imposed heavy taxes on the Papal States. He also proclaimed that living people could gain indulgences for souls already in purgatory. Pope Alexander VI (1492–1503), who became pope through bribery, used Church wealth to indulge his illegitimate children, including a daughter with whom he was alleged to have had sexual relations and a son who used papal armies in a bid to create his own kingdom. The next pope, Julius II (1503–1513), a vain and violent man, led wars to enlarge the papal domains and sold indulgences to finance lavish projects—including the construction of a grandiose new church, Saint Peter’s Basilica in Rome."
18,"Meanwhile, political unrest in Central Europe, the Reformation’s other root cause, spread among the German people. Irked by Italians, who saw themselves as culturally superior, many Germans resented the use of money collected in their lands, through indulgence sales and other Church payments, to fund the costly wars and ventures of the Renaissance popes. Devout Germans, such as those in the Brethren of the Common Life, a lay movement stressing piety and simplicity, were also dismayed by Church wealth and worldliness."
19,"Furthermore, the heads of the numerous German states were anxious to protect their autonomy against the ambitions of the Holy Roman emperor. Austrian Archduke Maximilian of Habsburg, elected emperor in 1493, seemed intent on ending this autonomy by transforming the empire into a centralized monarchy. By arranging favorable marriages for himself and his son, he also assured that his grandson, the future emperor Charles V (1519–1556), would inherit not only Austria, the Netherlands, Sicily, Sardinia, and much of Central Europe and Italy (Map 20.1) but also Spain (where he was King Carlos I) and its American empire. Alarmed, many German princes and nobles resolved to resist any further Habsburg ambitions."
20,20.1.2 The Lutheran Revolt
21,"Into these troubled waters waded Martin Luther (1483–1546), a devout German monk obsessed with fears of death and eternal damnation. As a young man he planned to study law but, when caught in a severe storm, vowed instead to enter a monastery if God let him survive. He lived to join the Augustinian order and became an exemplary monk, repeatedly fasting, praying, and confessing his sins. But he still felt unworthy of salvation and feared he was doomed to hell. A 1510 trip to Pope Julius II’s Rome only intensified his fears: how could a Church so worldly and corrupt help save his soul? In confronting this question, Luther plunged Western Christendom into turmoil."
22,"At the University of Wittenberg (VIT-in-bārg), in the central German state of Saxony, Luther studied scripture and became a doctor of theology, finally developing a doctrine that eased his torment. No one, he concluded, is worthy of salvation. It is not something one can earn by doing good works. It is rather a gift from God, who freely bestows his saving grace on those who have faith in him. We do not gain grace by doing good, reasoned Luther; we do good because we have grace. We are “justified” not by our deeds but by God’s grace, which we receive through faith."
23,"This doctrine of “justification by faith alone,” which would become the central tenet of a new Christian movement called Lutheranism, implicitly threatened the Catholic Church. For if faith alone brought salvation, who needed sacraments and indulgences? Indeed, who needed the Church?"
24,"Trouble arose in 1517 when a friar named John Tetzel traveled through German lands selling indulgences to build the new Saint Peter’s in Rome and pay the debts of a corrupt archbishop who had purchased his post. Assuring donors that the coins they put into his coffer would earn indulgences to free departed loved ones from purgatory, Tetzel allegedly used slogans like “As soon as the coin in the coffer rings, the soul from purgatory springs!”"
25,"Appalled, on October 31 Luther responded by issuing Ninety-Five Theses, propositions challenging the Church’s power to forgive sins and grant indulgences. Legend says he posted his theses on the Wittenberg Castle Church door."
26,"Read the following document, located at the end of this chapter: Martin Luther’s “Ninety-Five Theses” (1517)"
27,"The theses circulated widely, winning Luther broad support among Germans and religious reformers while evoking Rome’s anger. In a 1519 debate, he defended the views of John Hus and denounced the Church for Hus’s execution. In 1520 Luther published an Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation, urging German nobles to cast off Rome’s control and seize Church property, artfully appealing to both their German pride and their zest for wealth and power. The pope responded with a papal bull (edict) condemning Luther’s views as heresy."
28,"Luther burned the papal bull and continued his assault. God’s truth was found, he said, not in Church teachings but only in the Bible, which people must read and interpret themselves. He denied all sacraments except baptism and Communion, finding no biblical basis for the rest. He renounced not only indulgences but also belief in purgatory, pilgrimages, fasts, papal authority, and even monastic life. Proclaiming a priesthood of all believers, he rejected the celibate priesthood, encouraged ministers (no longer called priests) to marry, and replaced the conventional Catholic Latin Mass with worship in vernacular languages (like German) that people understood (Map 20.1)."
29,"In truth, then, Luther was not just a reformer who attacked abuses the Church could correct, but a rebel who denounced doctrines the Church saw as inspired by God. Luther essentially denied the Church’s authority and divine mission. And this no pope could accept."
30,20.1.3 The Rising Tide of Rebellion
31,"In 1521, alarmed at the danger Luther posed to both Church and empire, Holy Roman Emperor Charles V summoned Luther to face the Imperial Diet. Ordered to repudiate his views, the religious rebel held firm. Then, denounced by the emperor as a heretic, he was secretly taken to the castle of Saxony’s ruler, Frederick the Wise, a German prince dismayed by Church corruption and the emperor’s growing power. There Luther hid for a year and began translating the Bible into German."
32,"Read the following document, located at the end of this chapter: Excerpts from Luther’s Reply at Worms (1521)"
33,"Aided by the new printing press, developed by German inventor Gutenberg in the 1400s (Chapter 16), and by German nobles eager to expand their wealth and power at Church expense, Luther’s ideas spread quickly. Central Europe was soon divided between Lutherans, who adopted these new ideas, and Catholics, who stayed loyal to the emperor and pope."
34,"The situation soon grew more complex. By denying Church authority and urging people to interpret the Bible on their own, Luther freed others to dissent, fragmenting Christendom into additional sects. In 1522, a dissident priest named Huldrych Zwingli (TSVING-lē) began his own movement in Switzerland. More extreme than Luther, he rejected anything not literally in the Bible, including the belief that Christ is present in Communion bread and wine. Soon zealots called Anabaptists (or Rebaptizers), who baptized adults (rather than infants) as a sign of conscious faith commitment, split with Zwingli and started communities throughout Central Europe. Believing that the Church should be separate from the state, they opposed war, refused to take oaths, and suffered persecution as radical nonconformists."
35,"Other religious rebels backed radical social reforms, inspiring a violent Peasants’ Revolt against German nobles in 1524–1525. Zwingli supported it, but Luther did not. Reliant on noble support, and anxious to keep his religious movement from becoming a social rebellion, Luther urged authorities to “smash, strangle, and stab” the rebels, who were killed by the thousands."

37,"Meanwhile, neither emperor nor popes could stem the Lutheran tide. The emperor was resisted by an alliance of German Lutheran princes, called Protestants after 1529, when they formally protested his efforts to curb their religion. He was also diverted by wars against the Ottoman Turks, who conquered much of Hungary in 1526 and besieged Vienna in 1529 (Chapter 17), and even the Catholic French, who so greatly feared his power that they sided against him with Protestant German princes and Islamic Turks (Map 20.1). Several successive popes rejected calls for a Church council to confront the issues, fearing it might also reduce papal powers. And a growing conflict with England’s king further impeded the papacy."
38,20.1.4 Henry VIII and the English Reformation
39,"The English Reformation, unlike Luther’s, was rooted in royal affairs, not doctrinal disputes. Luther’s ideas did attract interest there, but English humanist Thomas More, though critical of Church corruption, condemned the Lutheran creed. And King Henry VIII (1509–1547) was a staunch Catholic who in 1521 issued a Defense of the Seven Sacraments, for which the pope proclaimed him “Defender of the Faith.” England seemed safely in the Roman Catholic fold."
40,"But things began to change in 1527, when Henry aspired to end his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, a Spanish princess by birth. She had borne him six children, but only one, their daughter, Mary, survived. As he and his wife got older, Henry feared he would have no male heir, leaving the realm in crisis after he died. Besides, he was in love with youthful Anne Boleyn (boo-LIHN), one of his wife’s attendants."
41,"The Church did not permit divorce, but it could grant an annulment, a ruling that the marriage had never been valid. Since Catherine had first wed Henry’s older brother and then, when he died, had married Henry, and since the Bible said a man who took his brother’s wife would die childless (Leviticus 20:21), Henry saw his lack of a son as a sign that God disapproved of his marriage to Catherine. He thus asked Rome to annul it."
42,"The request put Pope Clement VII (1523–1534) in a difficult bind. He did not want to anger Henry and risk losing England from the Church. But Catherine was the aunt of Emperor Charles V, whose soldiers occupied Rome, and whose help the Church needed against Luther and the Turks. And Charles opposed the annulment: Catherine’s marriage was his family’s link to England, which he hoped to strengthen by wedding his son Philip to Henry’s daughter, Mary, who would one day be queen if there were no male heir. Besides, since a prior pope (Julius II) had permitted Henry to wed his brother’s widow, an annulment would admit that popes erred, as Lutherans asserted. So Clement delayed his decision."
43,"As Henry’s case moved slowly through the papal courts, he grew increasingly impatient. By 1533, his mistress, Anne, was pregnant, so Henry could wait no longer. To legitimize his expected heir, he married Anne and got the Archbishop of Canterbury (England’s highest cleric), a Lutheran sympathizer named Thomas Cranmer, to annul his marriage to Catherine without waiting for Rome. Anne was crowned queen and a few months later gave birth—not to the desired son but to a girl who was named Elizabeth."
44,"Having acted on his own, in defiance of the pope, in 1534 Henry persuaded Parliament to pass an Act of Supremacy, naming him “supreme head of the Church of England” and formally breaking with Rome. Then, over the next five years, he closed the English monasteries and seized their property, selling much of it to local nobles. Henry thus ensured their support, since to keep their new lands the nobles would have to back him against the pope. But he also disbanded distinguished institutions that had been centers of learning and charity for centuries."
45,"Read the following document, located at the end of this chapter: The Act of Supremacy, passed by England’s Parliament (November 1534)"
46,"Henry also tarnished his legacy in other ways. In 1535, humanist Thomas More was beheaded for refusing to support the Act of Supremacy. In 1536, Anne Boleyn, having failed to produce a son, was accused of adultery and likewise beheaded. A third wife finally bore Henry a boy but perished while giving birth. The king went on to wed three more times before dying in 1547 (see Figure 20.1, Section 20.1.6)."
47,"Despite his break with the Roman Church, however, Henry VIII was no religious rebel. He stayed true to most Catholic teachings and resisted Protestant practices promoted by Luther and others. Only after Henry’s death did the Church of England adopt serious doctrinal changes."
48,20.1.5 Calvin and the Elect
49,"Meanwhile, a new religious rebel widened the Reformation. John Calvin (1509–1564), raised in France and trained as a lawyer and theologian, was initially attracted by Lutheran ideas. But in 1533 he reportedly had a conversion that crystallized his views in a flash of light. He concluded that faith, for Luther the key to salvation, was a gift that God gave only to certain people, and that the Roman Church was an evil institution that should not be reformed but destroyed."
50,"After fleeing to Switzerland to escape a crackdown on Protestants by French authorities, in 1536 Calvin published the Institutes of the Christian Religion, soon the central work of a Protestant movement called Calvinism. That same year he settled in Geneva, which under his influence soon became the center of the Protestant world."
51,"Calvin preached predestination, the notion that God long ago decided each person’s eternal fate. Some are destined for heaven and others for hell, no matter what they do. Earlier Church thinkers had promoted predestination but had not gone as far as Calvin in dismissing free will and personal choice. Like Luther, Calvin felt no one could earn salvation, but unlike Luther he believed God saved only the elect—those whom God had chosen beforehand for salvation."
52,"Although God alone knew who the elect were, Calvin’s followers felt that people like themselves, who led lives of faith and virtue, were among the elect. But for them faith and virtue were results of their salvation, not causes. Unlike Catholics, who led good lives in order to gain salvation, Calvinists did so as a sign that they were already saved. For Catholics, salvation came after one’s life and was based on how one had lived; for Calvinists, salvation came before one’s life and determined how one would live."
53,"Calvinists were “puritans,” promoting a strict moral code and “pure” religious practices. They held simple worship services, centered on sermons and Bible readings rather than elaborate rituals, in unadorned buildings rather than grandiose churches. Calvinists abhorred the ornate altars, vessels, statues, and stained-glass windows that adorned Catholic churches."
54,"The Calvinist model Christian community was Geneva, widely seen as the Protestant answer to Rome. Reformers came from all over Europe to experience Geneva’s religious life and learn from Calvin himself. A religious commission, under Calvin’s influence, supervised moral behavior, prohibiting offenses such as gambling, dancing, and drinking. Graver crimes, such as blasphemy, adultery, and witchcraft, were punished by secular leaders, who sometimes used torture and executions. Geneva thus was a sober and austere community."
55,20.1.6 The Spread of Protestantism
56,"Geneva sent disciples far and near to spread Calvinist beliefs, which took hold in parts of Northern and Central Europe, while Lutheranism spread from Germany to Scandinavia, and the Church of England embraced many Protestant beliefs (Map 20.2)."
57,"John Knox, one of Calvin’s followers, took the faith from Geneva home to Scotland, where it later became Presbyterianism. Calvinist communities also emerged in Bohemia, Hungary, and Poland; in the Netherlands, where they constituted the Dutch Reformed Church; in France, where they were called Huguenots (HYOO-guh-notz); and in England, where they were known as Puritans. Calvinist churches were largely independent of each other: rejecting the authoritarianism of popes and bishops, they formed no centralized international institution like the Catholic Church."
58,"Nor did the Lutherans develop one centralized church; instead, they relied on secular rulers to adopt the new faith for their domains. Many rulers did so, not only because they liked Luther’s ideas but also as a way to confiscate Catholic Church property and control religion in their realms. Aided by such rulers, Lutheranism spread across northern Germany and Scandinavia, becoming the main faith of the Baltic region."
59,"The Church of England, too, was controlled by the rulers, who after Henry VIII’s death began making it more Protestant. Under Henry’s sickly son Edward VI (1547–1553), Archbishop Cranmer brought in Protestant theologians, simplified liturgies, allowed priests to marry, and imposed his own Book of Common Prayer for church services. Queen Mary (1553–1558), the Catholic offspring of Henry’s first marriage, tried to restore full Catholicism, executing Cranmer and several hundred Protestants. But her efforts were undone by Queen Elizabeth I (1558–1603), the Protestant daughter from Henry’s second marriage. Determined to secure her throne by avoiding religious strife, Elizabeth pursued a middle path intended to satisfy most subjects. The English (or Anglican) Church thus combined Catholic-style liturgies and rituals, performed by bishops and priests, with the Protestant theology introduced under Cranmer."
60,"By the 1560s, Protestantism had spread throughout Northern and Central Europe and into parts of France and Eastern Europe (Map 20.2). But by then, the Catholic Church, still prevailing in the south, had launched a vigorous counterattack and extended its connections far beyond Europe."
61,20.2 The Catholic Counterreformation
62,How would you describe the Catholic response to the Protestant challenge?
63,"In the 1540s, after failing for years to stop the Protestants, Rome finally mounted an effective response. Pope Paul III (1534–1549) called a general council to initiate Church reforms, authorized tribunals to prosecute Protestants for heresy, and approved new religious orders that reinvigorated the Roman Church. He thus began the Catholic Reformation, also called the Catholic Counterreformation, since it involved a counterattack against Protestants."
64,20.2.1 The Council of Trent
65,"In 1545, after years of pressure from Emperor Charles V, Pope Paul III convened a great council of Catholic Church leaders. The Council of Trent, which met in 1545–1547, 1551–1552, and 1562–1563, shaped Catholic doctrine and worship for the next 400 years. Although Charles V wanted it to compromise with Lutherans, and some bishops wanted it to limit papal power, the council went the other direction. It affirmed many things that Protestants denied, including indulgences, papal supremacy, priestly celibacy, the Latin Mass, and the Church’s power to forgive sins. It insisted that salvation required both faith and good works, not faith alone. It declared that divine revelation came from both Bible and Church tradition, not Bible alone. It reasserted Church teaching that there were seven sacraments, not just the two (baptism and Communion) that Luther recognized. And to reinforce Church unity, the council reaffirmed the pope’s preeminence (see Map 20.1)."
66,"The Council of Trent also enacted reforms. Although it affirmed indulgences for pious deeds and prayers, the council forbade their sale, the practice that had triggered Luther’s revolt. To eliminate pluralism, the council allowed each bishop only one diocese in which he must reside. To improve the education of clergy, which Luther had derided as deficient, it ruled that each diocese must have a seminary, a training school for priests. These reforms did not win back the Protestants, but that was not their intent. They were designed to purify and strengthen Catholicism for battle against Protestantism, which lasted far longer than anyone at Trent could foresee."
67,"Read the following document, located at the end of this chapter: Excerpts from the Decrees of the Council of Trent (1545–1563)"
68,20.2.2 The Roman and Spanish Inquisitions
69,"The Counterreformation’s tactics were sometimes extreme. In central Italy and Spain, where Catholics were in control, they employed Inquisitions, Church tribunals to investigate, arrest, and prosecute people suspected of heretical beliefs. In Rome the Inquisition operated under the Holy Office, a council of six cardinals formed in 1542 by Pope Paul III. It fined, imprisoned, and sometimes executed people it convicted of false teachings. Starting in 1559, it also published an Index of Forbidden Books, works Catholics were forbidden to read without special permission. Officially designed to protect the faithful from heresy, the Index in time banned numerous works, including even novels such as Les Miserables and The Hunchback of Notre Dame (Chapter 27), perceived as offensive by the Church."
70,"The Spanish Inquisition, which functioned under Spain’s rulers, had been set up in 1478 to investigate Jews and Muslims who had outwardly converted to Catholicism. Now it also targeted people suspected of Protestant views. To extract confessions, inquisitors sometimes used tortures such as the rack, which stretched the victim’s body, and the thumbscrew, which crushed the victim’s thumbs. Those found guilty of heresy were often burned to death."
71,"Using closed trials, secret informers, tortures, and executions, the Inquisitions enforced Catholicism and virtually eradicated Protestantism in Italy and Spain. But elsewhere their main effect was to increase anti-Catholic hostility among Protestants, who sometimes employed similar methods against their religious foes."
72,20.2.3 New Religious Orders
73,"Amid this tumult, Catholicism had a spiritual revival, led by dynamic individuals and new religious orders. Even before the Reformation, the Brethren of the Common Life, an association of laypersons and clergy who led simple lives imitating Christ, had spread through Northern Europe. In Italy a similar group, the Oratory of Divine Love, stressed works of charity and devotion as antidotes to worldly corruption. In the 1530s an Italian woman, Angela Merici (muh-RĒ-chē) founded the Ursuline (UR-suh-līn) order, a community of nuns who educated Catholic girls in Italy, France, and the Americas. But the most influential new order was begun by a Spanish nobleman."
74,"Ignatius of Loyola.Ignatius of Loyola (1491–1556), an heir to Spain’s crusading tradition, was a soldier until 1521, when he was crippled in battle by a cannonball. During a long, painful recovery, he read books about Christ and Christian saints and then embarked on a spiritual crusade. He withdrew to a cave, where he prayed and lived in great austerity. There he developed the Spiritual Exercises, a four-week regimen of prayer and meditation designed to prepare one for selfless discipline in service to God and Church."
75,Click on blue circles below for more information.
76,"After a trip to the Holy Land and brushes with the Spanish Inquisition, Ignatius enrolled at the University of Paris, where he attracted a group of like-minded men. In 1537 they formed a “Company of Jesus,” and in 1540 Pope Paul III formally approved them as the Society of Jesus."
77,"Soon known as the Jesuits, they became Catholicism’s most zealous religious order. Highly selective, they accepted only men of talent and discipline. Organized on military lines, they vowed strict obedience to their superiors and the pope. Refusing to withdraw and live as monks or beggars, they served in the world as educators, missionaries, preachers, and political advisors."
78,"As educators, Jesuits combined Renaissance humanism (Chapter 16) with Catholic ideals, promoting both secular learning and religious faith, while creating a global network of schools and universities. As missionaries, they worked tirelessly to convert Amerinds, Africans, and Asians to Catholicism, helping to transform that European faith into a worldwide religion. As preachers to European Christians and advisors to Catholic rulers, they led an intensive anti-Protestant campaign, helping to stem the Protestant tide and even restoring parts of Central Europe to the Catholic fold. Known for both eloquence and political intrigue, they made many enemies, adding to Europe’s religious and political strife."
79,20.3 Religious and Political Strife in Europe
80,How would you analyze the main results of Europe’s religious and political strife?
81,"Europe’s religious and political strife, sparked by the Reformation and Counterreformation, lasted for more than a century. Bolstered by the riches of their Spanish overseas empire, the Catholic Habsburgs strove to impose their power and faith by force on Protestant regions. But the Protestants mounted an effective defense, perpetuating the fragmentation of Western Christianity."
82,20.3.1 The Spanish Catholic Crusade
83,"In 1556 Emperor Charles V, longtime Catholic champion and ruler of the Habsburg realms, retired to a monastery. Deeming his domains too vast for one ruler, he split them between his brother and his son. His brother, Ferdinand, received the Habsburg lands in Austria, Bohemia, and Hungary, and eventually succeeded Charles as Holy Roman emperor. His son, Philip, got the rest, including Spain and its American empire, the Netherlands, Sardinia, Sicily, and parts of Italy. As King Philip II, he ruled these lands from 1556 to 1598 (Map 20.1)."
84,"By this time Spain was Europe’s mightiest country, owing largely to its American empire. The conquest of the Aztecs and Inca, with their enormous riches (Chapter 18), was followed in 1545 by the discovery of vast silver deposits near Potosí (pō-tō-SĒ) in what is now Bolivia. These immense resources, exploited by Spaniards using Amerind and African slaves, soon supplied Spain with tremendous wealth, which Philip used to further the Catholic cause."
85,"A zealous Catholic, he launched a crusade to reinforce his religion in his realms and restore to his Church the lands it had lost. In Spain, he used the Inquisition to suppress Protestantism. In America, missionaries fostered his faith and his officials enforced it, so successfully that Spanish America became a Catholic stronghold. In the Mediterranean he joined forces with Venice and the pope to defeat the Turkish fleet at the Battle of Lepanto (near Greece) in 1571. Elsewhere, however, Philip ran into problems."
86,"Philip’s first setback came in England, which he hoped to restore to Catholicism with the help of its Catholic Queen Mary (1553–1558), who was also his wife. But in 1558 she died in a cholera epidemic, and her Protestant successor Elizabeth, spurning his marriage proposals, became a formidable foe."
87,"His next setback was the Dutch Revolt, a rebellion in the Netherlands against his rule. In 1566, alarmed that he might impose the Inquisition there, Dutch Calvinists rebelled, attacking Catholic churches and smashing sacred vessels, statues, stained-glass windows, and artwork. Enraged by this “Calvinist fury,” Philip tried to reassert control by executing rebels and confiscating lands of Calvinist nobles. By 1579 he subdued the Netherlands’ southern Catholic provinces, soon called the Spanish Netherlands (now Belgium). But the northern Protestant provinces then declared independence as the United Provinces of the Netherlands. This new nation, often called Holland (after its main province), fought Spain for three more decades."
88,"In 1585, fearing Spain might prevail and then use the Netherlands as a base to attack her country, England’s Queen Elizabeth sent money and troops to aid the Dutch. Philip, in turn, prepared to invade England. Tension increased in 1587, when Elizabeth approved the execution of her cousin Mary Stuart (Mary Queen of Scots), the Catholic claimant to the English throne. The next year Philip dispatched the “Invincible Catholic Armada,” a fleet of 130 huge ships, to land in the Netherlands and take the Spanish army to England."
89,"Its ships emblazoned with crosses and Catholic banners, the Armada set sail in May 1588. In July it met the English fleet in battles in the English Channel. England’s smaller and faster ships harassed the Armada’s huge vessels and then kept them from landing in the Netherlands."
90,"A fierce gale, which the English dubbed the “Protestant Wind,” also blew the Spanish off course, and further storms did even more damage as the Armada’s remnants, trying to return to Spain, sailed around Scotland and Ireland (Map 20.3)."

92,"The Spanish Armada’s defeat did not end the fighting, which continued until 1604. But it did help the English and Dutch to foil Philip’s Catholic crusade, to continue their Protestant course, to challenge Spain for control of the seas, and to found their own American colonies."
93,20.3.2 The Wars of Religion in France
94,"From 1562 to 1594, as Catholic Spain battled Dutch and English Protestants, France was torn by internal conflicts called the Wars of Religion. Although France remained mostly Catholic, about 7 percent of its people—and 40 percent of its nobles—were Calvinists. Known as Huguenots and led by the Bourbon family, they fought Catholic factions in a complex struggle for religious and political power. Catherine de Medicis (MED-ih-chē), the influential Italian mother of three Catholic kings who reigned from 1559 to 1589, tried to preserve her family’s power by reconciling hostile factions. In 1572, however, fearful of growing Protestant strength, she helped plot the massacre of several thousand Huguenots gathered in Paris for a wedding. But even this atrocity could not save Catherine’s clan. In 1589, following her death and the murder of her last royal son, the head of the Huguenot Bourbons inherited the throne as King Henri IV."
95,"French Catholics, however, refusing to accept a Protestant king, blocked Henri’s efforts to enter Paris and assume the throne. So Henri, pragmatically concluding that “Paris is well worth a Mass,” formally became a Catholic in 1593, thereby gaining acceptance in Paris as king in 1594."
96,"Seemingly betrayed by their champion, the Huguenots resisted Henri’s rule until 1598, when he won them over with religious toleration, issuing the Edict of Nantes (NAHNT). This historic document gave French Protestants full civil rights, the freedom to hold worship services in their own manors and towns, and the right to fortify these towns with their own troops. It also helped to make Henri IV one of France’s most popular kings. But Henri’s tolerant edict did not please everyone: in 1610 he was murdered by a fanatical Catholic. Religious animosities did not die easily in France."

98,20.3.3 The Thirty Years War
99,"Nor did they die easily in Germany, where Lutherans and Catholics for decades had observed an uneasy truce. In 1608, the Calvinists, prevalent in parts of the Holy Roman Empire, joined with Lutherans in an alliance called the Protestant Union. The next year, the Austrian Habsburgs, backed by their Spanish cousins’ wealth, created a rival coalition called the Catholic League, setting the stage for a calamitous conflict known as the Thirty Years War (1618–1648)."
100,"It began in 1618 with the “Defenestration of Prague” (dē-FEN-ih-STRĀ-shun: throwing someone out a window). Protestant nobles in Bohemia, irked by Habsburg efforts to restrict their rights, threw two imperial agents out of a high palace window. Despite their survival—credited by Catholics to divine intervention and by Protestants to the fact that they landed in a dung heap—the fragile peace was shattered. Emperor Ferdinand II (1619–1637), aided by the Catholic League and his Spanish relatives, crushed the Bohemians and other Protestant forces, moving steadily to bring all Germany under Catholic control. By 1629 the Protestant cause seemed lost."
101,"Then, however, two powerful outside forces intervened on the Protestant side. One was Gustavus Adolphus (gus-TAH-vus ah-DOLL-fus), Sweden’s Lutheran king, who feared for his realm should northern Germany come under Catholic rule. A gifted warrior, he defeated the Habsburgs in several key battles before dying in combat in 1632. The other force was Cardinal Richelieu (RISH-lih-YOO), France’s chief minister, who first supplied aid to the Protestants and then had France join the war on their side in 1635."
102,"As a cardinal in the Catholic Church, Richelieu seemed an unlikely supporter of Protestants. But his main loyalty was to France, which already faced Habsburg Spain to its south and the Spanish Netherlands to its north. Bent on blocking Habsburg unification of Germany to the east, he aided Protestants as a way to keep Germany divided and weak."
103,"The war’s last phase, from 1635 to 1648, was disastrous. France and Spain, both involved in the German conflict, battled each other as well. As warring armies crisscrossed Central Europe, disease and famine stalked the land. The German population was devastated, and wolves roamed the streets in desolate towns and villages."
104,"Although France and Spain fought on until 1659, the German nightmare ended in 1648 with the Peace of Westphalia (Map 20.4). Each German state remained autonomous, with rulers free to run their own affairs and decide if their realms should be Catholic, Lutheran, or Calvinist. The Holy Roman Empire retained only nominal authority and lost its Dutch, Swiss, and Italian states. The Habsburgs remained emperors, but their efforts to unify Germany and make it fully Catholic had failed. Europe remained divided along religious lines."
105,20.4 The Globalization of Western Christianity and Commerce
106,What were the main causes and effects of the globalization of Western Christianity and commerce?
107,"Europe’s fragmentation was, paradoxically, accompanied by global expansion. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, as Europe was torn by religious and political strife, European Christianity and commerce were spread across the globe by officials, missionaries, and merchants."
108,20.4.1 Catholicism’s Global Expansion
109,"Catholic empire builders and religious orders took the lead. The Spanish and Portuguese, who justified imperial expansion by claiming to carry Christianity to distant lands, systematically imposed their faith on those they conquered (Chapter 19). In their American colonies, where Iberian Catholics controlled governance and commerce and where Catholic priests and nuns ran missions and schools, most people became Catholics through coercion, convenience, or conviction."
110,"Jesuits, joined and often rivaled by other Catholic orders, also strove to implant Catholicism in Asia. In the 1540s Francis Xavier (ZĀ-vē-ur), one of the first Jesuits, worked among India’s poor pearl fishers and founded missions in Malaya and the Spice Islands. From 1549 to 1551, he lived in Japan, whose culture he greatly admired, and converted thousands to his faith. In 1552 he set out to proselytize China but died on an island off its coast."
111,"Xavier’s deep respect for Asians, and his tireless efforts to learn their languages and cultures, set an example for Jesuits who followed in his footsteps. They learned local languages, adapted local customs, and blended Catholic teachings into local cultures rather than seeking to impose European ways. Their success in Asia was limited by resistance from Asian religions and rulers and by Asian and Muslim perceptions of Westerners as culturally inferior. Still, spread by Jesuits and others, Catholicism became a global faith, with missions, parishes, schools, and followers around the world (Map 20.5)."
112,20.4.2 Merchant Capitalism and Global Trade
113,"As some Europeans globalized their faith, others transformed and globalized the economy. Western merchants, eager to enhance their incomes, worked to gain control over goods production and create global trading networks. European governments, seeking to increase state wealth, encouraged overseas commerce and exploitation of colonies."
114,"For centuries, merchants East and West had conducted interregional trade, engaging in practices—such as credit, banking, and marketing goods—later associated with capitalism, an economic system based on competition among private enterprises. But merchants usually did not manufacture the goods they sold. Goods were typically produced by artisans, who owned their tools and workshops; purchased raw materials such as metals, leather, wool, wood, and wax; and used their labor and skill to make them into finished products. The artisans then sold the goods to customers or merchants, often at prices fixed by artisans’ guilds. Merchants were mostly middlemen: traders who bought goods in one place, took them elsewhere, and sold them at a profit."
115,"From the fifteenth century onward, however, European merchants increasingly sought to enhance their profits by gaining control of production. They bought mines, woodlands, and herds of sheep and cattle, acquiring their own raw materials. They also bought tools and equipment and hired their own workers, reducing their dependence on artisans and guilds, many of whom in turn organized their own enterprises. Thus arose a dynamic new class of capitalists: entrepreneurs who created and ran enterprises that both manufactured and marketed goods."
116,"In this system, later called merchant capitalism, the merchant entrepreneur owned the means of production—tools, machines, and raw materials—and decided how much to produce and to charge for finished goods. The producer worked for the merchant and was paid a fixed wage or a prearranged price for each piece made. Finished products were thus owned by the entrepreneur, who arranged their transport and sale, setting prices to compete in a free market based on supply and demand. Over time, independent artisans were largely replaced by wage laborers, employed and paid by merchant capitalists."
117,"In expanding production and trade, merchant capitalists often found allies in their national monarchs. Rulers increasingly realized that, as commerce grew, so did their tax and tariff revenues, which they could use to hire armies and officials to expand their power. Rulers hence instituted policies, later known as mercantilism, that aimed to create a favorable balance of trade—one in which a country’s exports exceeded its imports in value. Since the nation as a whole would thus sell more than it bought, fortune supposedly would flow into the realm and into its royal treasury."
118,"Mercantilist policies therefore included government support of overseas trade. In the 1400s and 1500s, Portuguese voyagers backed by the government set up trading posts on African and Asian coasts, creating a commercial empire that made one of Europe’s smallest kingdoms one of its richest (Chapter 19). In the 1600s, England, the Netherlands, and France supported overseas trade through charter companies, trading associations protected by royal monopoly. Since overseas trade involved risks and expenses beyond what one investor could bear, merchants in these countries pooled their resources to form a large company in which many owned shares. To support the company and protect it from competition, the country’s ruler then issued a charter giving the company a monopoly of trade between that country and a specified region."
119,"Especially notable were the English East India Company, which monopolized commerce between England and India starting in 1600, and the Dutch United East India Company, founded two years later, which dominated trade between the Netherlands and the East Indies. For the next two centuries, these companies and others, with large fleets of merchant vessels, ran profitable trading posts in many parts of the world, gaining riches for themselves and their rulers. Global trading networks supplied European consumers with products from distant lands, such as silks, spices, sugar, coffee, tea, and tobacco, while revenues from this trade helped European monarchs centralize their governments and increase their power (Map 20.5)."
120,"20.4.3 Colonies, Commerce, and Religion"
121,"Overseas colonies also enhanced a country’s commerce and power. The foremost example was Spain, which used silver from its American colonies to buy luxury goods in Asia for resale elsewhere and to finance its powerful armies and navies, making it sixteenth-century Europe’s richest and mightiest realm. Another example was Portugal, which gained wealth in that century through the sale of sugar, grown in Brazil and other colonies using African slaves (Chapter 23)."
122,"Other Europeans, seeing these successes, imitated the Iberians by founding American colonies. The French set up trading posts in eastern Canada and the Mississippi Valley, bartering with Amerinds for animal furs that sold for fortunes in Europe. The Dutch did likewise in the Hudson Valley of what is now New York State. The English established a Virginia colony that prospered in time from tobacco, a crop Amerinds taught them to grow, which sold in Europe for big profits. The French, Dutch, and English also set up colonies on Caribbean islands that, like the Spanish West Indies and Portuguese Brazil, profited immensely from slave-grown sugar. By the late 1600s, bolstered by wealth from their commerce and colonies, England, France, and the Netherlands had replaced Spain and Portugal as Europe’s dominant political and economic powers."
123,"These developments also had religious implications. France, like Spain and Portugal, promoted Catholicism in its colonies, aided by Jesuits and other French priests who worked among French settlers and Amerinds. Dutch Calvinists established settlements in the Hudson Valley, while English Calvinists called Puritans, fleeing persecution in their homeland, moved in large numbers to what became New England starting in the 1620s. English Catholics colonized Maryland in succeeding decades, while Anglicans and other English Protestants formed new North American colonies. By the mid-1600s, like Europe itself, North America had a variety of Christian denominations (Map 20.5)."
124,20.5 Western Society in an Age of Religious and Economic Change
125,In what ways was Western society affected by religious and economic change?
126,"As Europeans spread their creeds and commerce to diverse lands and peoples, religious divisions and global expansion transformed Europe’s society. Religious strife fostered suffering and fear, while global expansion fostered growing prosperity."
127,"20.5.1 Warfare, Disease, and Witch Hunts"
128,"Religious upheaval brought hardship to many Europeans. Religious leaders and warriors, fueled by righteous fury, conducted wars and persecutions, claiming to be doing God’s will. Bands of armed fighters, feeding on the chaos, roamed the countryside looting, pillaging, and raping. Dislocation and devastation followed in their footsteps."
129,"Adding to sixteenth-century anxieties was a pandemic of syphilis, a sexually transmitted disease whose victims suffered sores and rashes, and later often blindness, insanity, and death. Some experts think syphilis was a virulent form of an earlier European ailment; others think European sailors brought it from the Americas after contracting it from Amerinds. Either way, it spread fear in Europe, where it was called the great pox (as distinguished from smallpox) or the “French disease” (as often blamed on French soldiers)."
130,"Even more unsettling were the witch hunts of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. At least a hundred thousand people, mostly women, were put on trial for witchcraft, supposedly for using supernatural powers to make evil things happen. Perhaps fifty thousand were executed for this alleged crime."
131,"Various factors fueled the witch hunts. One was the Reformation, which led Catholics and Protestants alike to persecute heretics and to accuse dissenters of doing the devil’s work. Luther, Calvin, and the Catholic Church all favored burning witches. Another factor was the misery bred by religious war, leading many to seek scapegoats for the suffering. A third factor was the syphilis pandemic, causing miscarriages, stillbirths, blindness, and insanity, easily ascribed to the occult. A fourth may have been a cooling climate, marked by long cold winters and harsh weather, causing crop failures and other disasters widely blamed on witchcraft."
132,"A fifth factor was Malleus Maleficarum (MAH-lā-oos MAH-lā-fē-CAH-room), “The Hammer of the Wicked,” a pamphlet published by two Dominicans in 1486. Circulated widely in the next two centuries, it sought to supply an explanation of witchcraft. It said witches made pacts with the devil, sealed by sex with him, which empowered them to make evil things happen. It portrayed witches mainly as women, whom it considered weaker than men and more easily won over to evil. Witches were said to meet devils at assemblies called synagogues or sabbaths, indirectly linking witchcraft to Jewish worship."
133,"Read the following document, located at the end of this chapter: Excerpts from Malleus Maleficarum (1487)"
134,"Those accused of witchcraft were usually women, typically single or widowed, aging, and poor, who often had no family to protect them and thus were easy targets. Older women, beyond childbearing age, were sometimes seen as burdens on society and accused of erratic behavior. Aging might bring deeper voices and haggard appearance, leading fearful neighbors to label them “hags.” Women’s customary roles as midwives and healers also left them open to blame when infants or sick people died. Such circumstances, and depictions of women as tools of the devil going back to the biblical Eve, reinforced the tendency to link witchcraft with women."
135,Click on blue circles below for more information.
136,"Women depicted as witches were blamed for varied misfortunes, such as accidents, illness, sudden death, bad weather, infertility, and sexual impotence. Charges were typically brought by someone who had suffered a loss, or by professional witch hunters who made careers of targeting witches. Many of the accused were tortured, often until they confessed or implicated others to save themselves. The convicted might be burned to death, hanged (in England), banished, or imprisoned. Some may actually have tried witchcraft, but most were no doubt innocent victims of fear, superstition, and witch hunts."
137,20.5.2 Social Effects of Economic Expansion
138,"Less dramatic but more enduring were changes wrought in Western society by capitalism and global trade. The main beneficiaries were the growing middle classes who lived in towns (burgs) and cities, and hence were called burghers or bourgeoisie (boorzh-wah-ZĒ). They included merchants and bankers who profited from trade; doctors, lawyers, and others who prospered by serving wealthy people’s needs; and artisans and manufacturers who raised prices on their products as more wealth became available."
139,"Global trade helped prosperous townsfolk live well, enjoying cottons, furs, tea, coffee, sugar, spices, and later tobacco and chocolate, imported from the Americas and Asia. Towns and cities sported markets, plazas, taverns, inns, banks, shops, and rows of tidy townhouses. Wealthy bourgeoisie even challenged the nobles for social and political preeminence. But many wage laborers were hurt as prices rose faster than their incomes. And the urban poor, roughly half the townsfolk, lived in squalid slums full of vermin, beggars, criminals, prostitutes, drunks, and gangs."
140,"The changing economy also affected the nobles, descendants of medieval lords and owners of rural estates. Many came to live in cities, dwelling in elegant townhouses and enjoying luxuries supplied by global trade, while hired stewards ran their rural estates. To enhance their incomes, some nobles invested in commerce or married their young to children of wealthy bourgeoisie. In Western Europe, where access to sea trade enhanced the size and wealth of the bourgeoisie, the nobles’ power declined as monarchs and merchants shaped strong political and economic institutions. But in Central and Eastern Europe, where lack of access to such commerce kept urban middle classes small and weak, nobles retained their political and economic dominance."
141,"Initially, the peasants, who lived in rural villages with little access to the wonders of the wider world, were little affected by the economic changes. Occasionally they might travel to a town to visit its markets or attend an annual fair. Usually, however, they rose with the sun, worked the fields by day, and retired to their village by night. In Eastern Europe most peasants were still serfs, bound in service to their landlords; in the West, most were legally free but subject to burdensome taxes and dues."
142,"By the 1600s, however, capitalist commerce was affecting many peasants. To bypass town artisans and guilds, merchants started lending, or “putting out” equipment and raw materials (such as weaving looms and wool) to peasant families, who used them to make products (such as clothing) in their own huts and cottages. The merchant capitalist paid a fixed price for items thus produced and then sold them at lower cost than goods made by guild artisans. This “putting out” system, later called cottage industry or the “domestic system,” lowered merchants’ costs and the price of goods while raising peasant incomes and making them less beholden to the landlords."
143,Click on blue circles below for more information.
144,"20.5.3 Family, Gender, Education, and Diet"
145,"Religious and economic change also affected family patterns, gender roles, education, and diet. Arising in the 1500s, these effects became increasingly visible in the following century."
146,"In the 1500s, as in eras past, the basic units of Western society were patriarchal families headed by men. Noblemen were lords of the family estate and often also military officers or government officials. Middle-class men ran the family business or practiced the family trade, while peasant men farmed the strips of land allotted to their family in fields around their village. As household heads and providers, men expected to be served by their wives and to make key decisions for their children, including assignment of family duties and selection of spouses."
147,"Although seen as subservient to men, women played central roles in family life. They raised children, baked bread, prepared meals, and made clothes, using social circles to support and learn from other women. Women also were midwives and caregivers, delivering babies and treating illnesses with folk remedies passed on from previous generations. Lower-class mothers nursed their own infants, while wealthy women hired wet nurses to breast-feed theirs. Peasant women sustained their families mainly on dark bread and soups made from peas, beans, cabbages, and carrots, supplemented sometimes by eggs, butter, and cheese. Meat meals, white bread, and sweet pastries, standard fare for upper classes, were rare among common people."
148,"Yet women had little control over their own lives. Parents arranged their marriages, often caring more for enhancing family status than for their daughters’ happiness. Women who wound up with drunken, abusive, or unfaithful husbands had little choice but to endure their plight—and women who tried to run away could be tracked down and returned. Since childhood diseases killed 20 to 30 percent of all children, women commonly bore at least six or seven children to ensure that some would survive to adulthood."
149,"By the 1600s, despite much continuity, basic family patterns were changing. Increased income from commerce and cottage industry helped many married couples maintain their own households rather than live with their extended families. Nuclear families, made up of only parents and children, increasingly became the norm. And, although their parents still had to approve their marriages, young people increasingly chose their own spouses, often after years of courtship, waiting to wed until their mid-twenties when they could support themselves. Divorce and remarriage, banned by the Catholic Church, were typically allowed among Protestants, especially in cases of adultery or abuse."
150,"Learning and literacy likewise became more common. Increasing numbers of books produced by printing presses, combined with Protestant emphasis on individual reading of the Bible, accelerated the spread of education. Protestant pastors and Catholic orders set up schools to teach reading and writing, not only to offspring of merchants and nobles but also to growing numbers of lower-class children. Although mainly boys attended schools, prosperous parents increasingly educated their daughters too, enabling them to play larger roles in social and cultural life."
151,"European diets also evolved as new foods from the Americas were added. In the seventeenth century, European farmers began growing crops developed by Amerinds, such as corn (maize), which originated in Mexico, and potatoes, which came from Peru. Potatoes proved especially useful, since they took less space to cultivate than grains, were easier to preserve, and could feed more people. Global connections thus enhanced Europe’s food supply as well as its prosperity."
152,20.5.4 Changes in the Role of Religion
153,"Religion’s role was likewise altered in the age of religious conflict. Before the Reformation, most Europeans sought salvation through the Church, so religion was central to society. The Church provided sacraments and religious education, collected and distributed donations for the poor, and kept records of births, deaths, baptisms, and marriages. It also offered festival occasions, including baptisms, weddings, and holy days such as Christmas and Easter. It even condoned midwinter Carnival festivities—also called Shrovetide, Mardi Gras (MAR-dē GRAH), or Fasching (FAH-shing)—during which people donned costumes and ate and drank excessively in preparation for Lent, a 40-day period of fasting and sacrifice preceding Easter."
154,"After the Reformation, changing outlooks started altering religion’s role. Protestants needed no Church for salvation, so their faith was often private and plain, marked by Bible reading at home and simple Sunday services. Their sober moral code also disfavored excessive pre-Lenten festivities, while their certainty of salvation removed the need for Lenten fasts and sacrifices."
155,"Religious wars and witch hunts also bred disenchantment with religion, while growing prosperity left Europeans less focused on death and salvation. In Protestant areas, and even Catholic lands, the saints, shrines, monasteries, pilgrimages, and fasts that earlier meant so much grew less important. Freed by Luther and Calvin from the need to earn salvation, many Protestants focused on material success—and ambitious Catholics did too."
156,"Most people still worshipped and prayed, but their lives were less centered on religion than before, and they were less inclined to look to religious leaders for guidance. Europe’s age of religious conflict, begun by efforts to enhance religion and diminish the wealth and worldliness of the Roman Church, instead diminished the role of religion and enhanced the wealth and worldliness of European society."
157,"Conclusion: The West in an Age of Religious Conflict and Global Expansion, 1500–1650"
158,
159,"In the early 1500s, hoping to reform the Catholic Church, reduce Church corruption, improve public morals, and increase people’s piety, religious reformers started a rebellion that came to be known as the Protestant Reformation. They were supported by many political leaders, alarmed at the growing power of the Habsburg rulers, and by numerous people who resented Church extravagance, financed by donations of the faithful."
160,"But the Reformation’s outcome was not what its originators intended. It shattered Europe’s religious unity, generating numerous new beliefs and competing Christian churches, as religious strife and zeal fueled wars, inquisitions, persecutions, and witch hunts. Central Europe was left divided and weak, thwarting Habsburg efforts to transform the Holy Roman Empire into a centralized state. And Europe was left divided among diverse states, each with its own religious institutions and issues."
161,"Despite this destruction and division, however, Europe’s wealth and influence expanded. The worldwide spread of Western Christianity, the growth of global commerce and capitalism, the exploitation of the Americas, the flourishing of the bourgeoisie, and advances in literacy and learning all enriched European countries, especially those that bordered the Atlantic. By the late 1600s, profiting from connections created by global expansion, the West was emerging from religious strife more prosperous and powerful than ever."

173,"Martin Luther’s Ninety-Five Theses is a document that constituted the start of the Protestant Reformation. Luther was not the first to challenge the church in terms of religious doctrine and its role in earthly affairs. Although Jan Hus and others predated Luther, his actions marked the start of the broader Protestant movement. This document contains a selection of Luther’s concerns, with a focus on one of the major issues of his time: the Catholic Church’s selling of indulgences."
174,"Out of love and concern for the truth, and with the object of eliciting it, the following heads will be the subject of a public discussion at Wittenberg under the presidency of the reverend father, Martin Luther, Augustinian, Master of Arts and Sacred Theology, and duly appointed Lecturer on these subjects in that place. He requests that whoever cannot be present personally to debate the matter orally will do so in absence in writing."
175,"1. When our Lord and Master, Jesus Christ, said “Repent”, He called for the entire life of believers to be one of penitence...."
176,5. The pope has neither the will nor the power to remit any penalties beyond those imposed either at his own discretion or by canon law.
177,"6. The pope himself cannot remit guilt, but only declare and confirm that it has been remitted by God; or, at most, he can remit it in cases reserved to his discretion. Except for these cases, the guilt remains untouched."
178,"20. Therefore the pope, in speaking of the plenary remission of all penalties, does not mean “all” in the strict sense, but only those imposed by himself."
179,21. Hence those who preach indulgences are in error when they say that a man is absolved and saved from every penalty by the pope’s indulgences….
180,27. There is no divine authority for preaching that the soul flies out of purgatory immediately the money chinks in the bottom of the chest.
181,"28. It is certainly possible that when the money chinks in the bottom of the chest avarice and greed increase; but when the church offers intercession, all depends on the will of God."
182,"32. All those who believe themselves certain of their own salvation by means of letters of indulgence, will be eternally damned, together with their teachers."
183,"35. It is not in accordance with Christian doctrine to preach and teach that those who buy off souls, or purchase confessional licenses, have no need to repent of their own sins."
184,"36. Any Christian whatsoever, who is truly repentant, enjoys plenary remission from penalty and guilt, and this is given him without letters of indulgence."
185,"37. Any true Christian whatsoever, living or dead, participates in all the benefits of Christ and the church; and this participation is granted to him by God without letters of indulgence."
186,"43. Christians should be taught that one who gives to the poor, or lends to the needy, does a better action than if he purchases indulgences."
187,"45. Christians should be taught that he who sees a needy person, but passes him by although he gives money for indulgences, gains no benefit from the pope’s pardon, but only incurs the wrath of God."
188,"50. Christians should be taught that, if the pope knew the exactions of the indulgence preacher he would rather the church of St. Peter were reduced to ashes than be built with the skin, flesh, and bones of his sheep."
189,62. The true treasure of the church is the Holy Gospel of the glory and the grace of God.
190,75. It is foolish to think that papal indulgences have so much power that they can absolve a man even if he has done the impossible and violated the mother of God.
191,"76. We assert the contrary, and say that the pope’s pardons are not able to remove the least venial of sins as far as their guilt is concerned."
192,"81. This unbridled preaching of indulgences makes it difficult for learned men to guard the respect due to the pope against false accusations, or at least from the keen criticisms of the laity…."
193,"82. They ask, e.g.: Why does not the pope liberate everyone from purgatory for the sake of love (a most holy thing) and because of the supreme necessity of their souls? This would be morally the best of all reasons. Meanwhile he redeems innumerable souls for money, a most perishable thing, with which to build St. Peter’s church, a very minor purpose."
194,"86. Again: Since the pope’s income to-day is larger than that of the wealthiest of wealthy men, why does he not build this one church of St. Peter with his own money, rather than with the money of indigent believers?"
195,"90. These questions are serious matters of conscience to the laity. To suppress them by force alone, and not to refute them by giving reasons, is to expose the church and the pope to the ridicule of their enemies, and to make Christian people unhappy."
196,"91. If, therefore, indulgences were preached in accordance with the spirit and mind of the pope, all these difficulties would be easily overcome, and, indeed, cease to exist."
197,"94. Christians should be exhorted to be zealous to follow Christ, their Head, through penalties, deaths, and hells."
198,95. And let them thus be more confident of entering heaven through many tribulations rather than through a false assurance of peace.

203,"The second group of books is written against the papacy and papal scheming and action, that is against those who through evil teaching and example have ruined Christendom laying it waste with the evils of the spirit and the soul. No one can deny or obscure this fact, since experience and complaint of all men testify that the conscience of Christian believers is sneered at, harassed and tormented by the laws of the Pope and the doctrines of men. Likewise the goods and wealth of this most famous German nation were and are devoured through unbelievable tyranny … Were I, therefore, to revoke these books I would only strengthen this tyranny…"
204,"Since your Imperial Majesty and Lordships demand a simple answer I will do so … as follows: Unless I am convicted by the testimony of Scripture or by evident reason—for I trust neither in popes nor in councils alone, since it is obvious that they have often erred and contradicted themselves … my conscience is captive by the Word of God. Therefore I cannot and will not recant, since it is … dangerous indeed to do anything against one’s conscience. God help me. Amen."

207,"First published in 1487, the Malleus Maleficarum described the nature of witchcraft, the role the Devil played in its practice, and the most effective methods for detecting, interrogating, and punishing witches. The Malleus Maleficarum was a key authority cited in sixteenth-century witchcraft investigations and trials. As you will read in the excerpt below, one of the central claims made by its authors was that women were by nature more likely than men to be witches."
208,"Let us now … consider women; and … why this kind of perfidy is found more in so fragile a sex than in men.… And the first [reason] is that they are more credulous; and since the chief aim of the devil is to corrupt faith, therefore he rather attacks them.… The second reason is that women are naturally more impressionable, and more ready to receive the influence of a disembodied spirit.… The third reason is that they have slippery tongues, and are unable to conceal from the fellow-women those things which by evil arts they know; and … they find an easy and secret manner of vindicating themselves by witchcraft … since they are feebler both in mind and body."
209,"But the natural reason is that she is more carnal than a man.… Therefore a wicked woman is by her nature quicker to waver in her faith, and consequently quicker to abjure the faith, which is the root of witchcraft. And as to her other mental quality, that is, her natural will; when she hates someone whom she formerly loved, then she seethes with anger and impatience in her whole soul.… Women also have weak memories; and it is a natural vice in them not to be disciplined, but to follow their own impulses,… Let us consider another property of hers, the voice. For as she is a liar by nature, so in her speech she stings while she delights us.… Let us consider also her gait, posture, and habit.… There is no man in the world who studies so hard to please the good God as even an ordinary woman studies by her vanities to please men.…"
210,"To conclude. All witchcraft comes from carnal lust, which is in women insatiable.… Wherefore for the sake of fulfilling their lusts they consort even with devils …, it is no . . . wonder that there are more women than men found infected with the heresy of witchcraft.…"

213,"The Act of Supremacy marked a key turning point in the English Reformation. In passing the Act, Parliament gave formal, legal status to England’s break with the Roman Catholic Church. From that point forward, Henry VIII was the head of the Church of England, serving both as supreme political and religious leader in the realm. For English Catholics, the Act of Supremacy was an abomination and a violation of God’s law. For many radical Protestants, the Church of England did not go nearly far enough in breaking with the teachings and traditions of the Catholic Church."
214,"Albeit the King's Majesty justly and rightfully is and ought to be the supreme head of the Church of England, and so is recognized by the clergy of this realm in their Convocations, yet nevertheless for corroboration and confirmation thereof, and for increase of virtue in Christ's religion within this realm of England, and to repress and extirpate all errors, heresies and other enormities and abuses heretofore used in the same:"
215,"Be it enacted by authority of this present Parliament, that the King, our sovereign lord, his heirs and successors, kings of this realm, shall be taken, accepted and reputed the only supreme head in earth of the Church of England, called Anglicana Ecclesia; and shall have and enjoy, annexed and united to the imperial crown of this realm, as well the title and style thereof, as all honors, dignities, pre-eminences, jurisdictions, privileges, authorities, immunities, profits and commodities to the said dignity of supreme head of the same Church belonging and appertaining; and that our said sovereign lord, his heirs and successors, kings of this realm, shall have full power and authority from time to time to visit, repress, redress, reform, order, correct, restrain and amend all such errors, heresies, abuses, offenses, contempts and enormities, whatsoever they be, which by any manner, spiritual authority or jurisdiction ought or may lawfully be reformed, repressed, ordered, redressed, corrected, restrained or amended, most to the pleasure of Almighty God, the increase of virtue in Christ's religion, and for the conservation of the peace, unity and tranquility of this realm, any usage, custom, foreign law, foreign authority, prescription or any other thing or things to the contrary hereof notwithstanding."

218,"Over the course of almost twenty years, the Council of Trent worked on reforming the Catholic Church in response to the challenges posed by the Protestant Reformation. The council’s decrees would guide the teachings, organization, and mission of the Church for centuries to come. The reforms did much to slow the spread of Protestantism in Europe and to improve the reputation of the Church as a spiritual body. In the excerpts from the decrees included below, Church leaders laid out core teachings, as well as the scriptural foundation for the Church’s institutional authority."
219,"The universal Church has always understood that the complete confession of sins was instituted by the Lord, and is of divine right necessary for all who have fallen into sin after baptism; because our Lord Jesus Christ, when about to ascend from earth, to heaven, left priests … as leaders and judges, before whom all the mortal offenses into which the faithful of Christ may have fallen should be carried, in order that, in accordance with the power of the keys, they may pronounce the sentence of forgiveness or of retention of sins…"
220,"Venial sins, whereby we are not excluded from the grace of God, and into which we fall more frequently, although they may be included right and profitably … in confession, as the custom of pious persons shows …, may be omitted without guilt … But since all mortal sins, even those of thought, render men … enemies of God, it is necessary to seek pardon from God for every mortal sin, by a full and modest confession…"
221,"This holy Council enjoins on all bishops and others who are charged with teaching, that they instruct the faithful diligently concerning the intercession and invocation of saints, the honor paid to relics, and the legitimate use of images. Let them teach that the saints, who reign together with Christ, offer up their own prayers to God for men; that it is good and useful …to invoke them, and to have recourse to their prayers and aid in obtaining benefits from God, through his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, who is our sole Redeemer and Savior; and that those persons think impiously who deny that the saints, who enjoy eternal happiness in heaven, are to be invoked; or who assert that the saints do not pray for men, or that the invocation of them to pray for each of us individually is idolatry; or who declare that it is repugnant to the word of God…"
222,"They shall likewise teach that the holy bodies of martyrs, and of others now living with Christ … are to be venerated by the faithful, through which relics many benefits are bestowed by God on men. Consequently they who affirm that veneration and honor are not due to the relics of saints, or that these and other sacred memorials are uselessly honored by the faithful, and that the places dedicated to the memories of the saints are visited in vain …, are wholly to be condemned…"
223,"Moreover they shall teach that the images of Christ, of the Virgin Mother of God, and of the other saints are to be placed and retained particularly in churches, and that full honor and veneration are to be given them; not that … they are to be worshipped …, or that trust is to be reposed in images, as was of old done by the heathen who placed their hope in idols; but because the honor which is shown them is referred to the [persons] those images represent; [so] that by means of the images … we adore Christ, and we venerate the saints, whose similitude they bear …."
224,"If anyone says that the New Testament does not provide for a distinct, visible priesthood; or that this priesthood [does not have] any power of consecrating and offering up the true body a and blood of the Lord, and of forgiving and retaining sins, but is only an office and bare ministry of preaching the gospel …, let him be anathema…"
225,"If anyone says that in the Catholic Church there is not a hierarchy instituted by divine ordination, consisting of bishops, priests, and ministers; let him be anathema."
226,"If anyone says that the sacraments of the new law were not all instituted by Jesus Christ, our Lord; or that they are more or less than seven, to wit, baptism, confirmation, the eucharist, penance, extreme unction, orders, and matrimony; or even that any one of these seven is not truly and properly a sacrament; let him be anathema."
227,"In order that the faithful may approach and receive the sacraments with greater reverence and devotion of mind, this holy Council enjoins on all bishops … not only [to] … explain [to] … those who receive them, the efficacy and use of those sacraments, but [also to] endeavor that the same be done piously and prudently by every parish priest …Such instruction shall he given in accordance with the form which will be prescribed for each of the sacraments by this holy Council in a catechism, which the bishops shall take care to have faithfully translated into [various languages] … and to have expounded to the people by all parish priests…"
228,"It is to be desired that those who undertake the office of bishop should understand … that they are called, not to their own convenience, not to riches or luxury, but to labors and cares, for the glory of God. For it is not to be doubted that the rest of the faithful also will be more easily excited to religion and innocence if they shall see those who are set over them not fixing their thoughts on the things of this world, but on the salvation of souls and on their heavenly country. Wherefore this holy Council … admonishes all bishops,… by their actual deeds and the actions of their lives,… [to set] examples of frugality, modesty, continence, and of that holy humility which so much commends us to God."
229,"Wherefore … this Council not only orders that bishops be content with modest furniture and a frugal table and diet, but …also … that in the rest of their manner of living, and in their whole house, there be nothing …which does not manifest simplicity, zeal toward God, and a contempt of vanities."
230,"It strictly forbids them, moreover, to strive to enrich their own [relatives] out of the revenues of the Church; … yea, this holy Council, with the utmost earnestness, admonishes them completely to lay aside all this human and carnal affection towards brothers, nephews, and [relatives], which is the seed plot of many evils in the Church. And what has been said of bishops, the same is to be observed by all who hold ecclesiastical [offices]…, each according to the nature of his rank. . ."

233,"Henry IV (1589–1610) led the Huguenot cause during the French wars of religion. He hailed from Navarre in modern-day northern Spain and was raised by a mother who valued intelligence and a strong will. The assassination of Henry III brought Henry IV to the throne in 1589. Despite a life of service to the Protestant cause, Henry IV converted to Catholicism, as it was clear he would not be accepted as a legitimate ruler of France otherwise. The Edict of Nantes represented a compromise that eased tensions between the Catholic and Protestant factions in France. Though future kings would dilute the principles of toleration expressed in this royal proclamation, the Edict of Nantes represents a key moment in the slow decline of religious tensions that engulfed Europe following the Protestant Reformation."
234,"Henry, by the grace of God king of France and of Navarre, to all to whom these presents come, greeting:"
235,"Among the infinite benefits which it has pleased God to heap upon us, the most signal and precious is his granting us the strength and ability to withstand the fearful disorders and troubles which prevailed on our advent in this kingdom. The realm was so torn by innumerable factions and sects that the most legitimate of all the parties was fewest in numbers. God has given us strength to stand out against this storm; we have finally surmounted the waves and made our port of safety—peace for our state. For which his be the glory all in all, and ours a free recognition of his grace in making use of our instrumentality in the good work. . . . We implore and await from the Divine Goodness the same protection and favor which he has ever granted to this kingdom from the beginning. . ."
236,"We have, by this perpetual and irrevocable edict, established and proclaimed and do establish and proclaim:"
237,"First, that the recollection of everything done by one party or the other between March, 1585, and our accession to the crown, and during all the preceding period of troubles, remain obliterated and forgotten, as if no such things had ever happened."
238,"We ordain that the Catholic Apostolic and Roman religion shall be restored and reestablished in all places and localities of this our kingdom and countries subject to our sway, where the exercise of the same has been interrupted, in order that it may be peaceably and freely exercised, without any trouble or hindrance; forbidding very expressly all persons, of whatsoever estate, quality, or condition, from troubling, molesting, or disturbing ecclesiastics in the celebration of divine service, in the enjoyment or collection of tithes, fruits, or revenues of their benefices, and all other rights and dues belonging to them; and that all those who during the troubles have taken possession of churches, houses, goods or revenues, belonging to the said ecclesiastics, shall surrender to them entire possession and peaceable enjoyment of such rights, liberties, and sureties as they had before they were deprived of them."
239,"And in order to leave no occasion for troubles or differences between our subjects, we have permitted, and herewith permit, those of the said religion called Reformed to live and abide in all the cities and places of this our kingdom and countries of our sway, without being annoyed, molested, or compelled to do anything in the matter of religion contrary to their consciences . . . upon condition that they comport themselves in other respects according to that which is contained in this our present edict."
240,"It is permitted to all lords, gentlemen, and other persons making profession of the said religion called Reformed, holding the right of high justice [or a certain feudal tenure], to exercise the said religion in their houses."
241,"We also permit those of the said religion to make and continue the exercise of the same in all villages and places of our dominion where it was established by them and publicly enjoyed several and divers times in the year 1597, up to the end of the month of August, notwithstanding all decrees and judgements to the contrary."
242,"We very expressly forbid to all those of the said religion its exercise, either in respect to ministry, regulation, discipline, or the public instruction of children, or otherwise, in this our kingdom and lands of our dominion, otherwise than in the places permitted and granted by the present edict."
243,"It is forbidden as well to perform any function of the said religion in our court or retinue, or in our lands and territories beyond the mountains, or in our city of Paris, or within five leagues of the said city."
244,"We also forbid all our subjects, of whatever quality and condition, from carrying off by force or persuasion, against the will of their parents, the children of the said religion, in order to cause them to be baptized or confirmed in the Catholic Apostolic and Roman Church; and the same is forbidden to those of the said religion called Reformed, upon penalty of being punished with especial severity."
245,"Books concerning the said religion called Reformed may not be printed and publicly sold, except in cities and places where the public exercise of the said religion is permitted."
246,"We ordain that there shall be no difference or distinction made in respect to the said religion, in receiving pupils to be instructed in universities, colleges, and schools; nor in receiving the sick and poor into hospitals, retreats and public charities."
247,"Those of the said religion called Reformed shall be obliged to respect the laws of the Catholic Apostolic and Roman Church, recognized in this our kingdom, for the consummation of marriages contracted, or to be contracted, as regards the degrees of consanguinity and kinship."
